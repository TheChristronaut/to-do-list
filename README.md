This project is a task manager application that allows you to create projects and then assign tasks to those projects. It was built using HTML CSS and JavaScript and is my first project that includes storage of user data as to not lose your list if you refresdh the page or close the browser.

I also opted to use Parcel as a bundler for this project, to handle dependencies.
